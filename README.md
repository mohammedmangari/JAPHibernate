# JAPHibernate





The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a specification for managing data in a relational database using Java. It provides a way to map Java objects to relational database tables and vice versa, as well as a way to manage the data in the database using Java code. JPA defines a set of standard interfaces and annotations that can be used to define the mapping between Java objects and the database, as well as a set of API calls for performing common operations, such as inserting, updating, and querying data in the database.
It is implemented by various ORM (Object-relational mapping) frameworks like Hibernate, EclipseLink, OpenJPA etc. These frameworks provide a concrete implementation of the JPA specification and can be used to interact with a variety of different databases.
